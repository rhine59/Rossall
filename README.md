## An Introduction

![Introduction](images/2021/09/introduction.png)

NOTE: CAA subsidies for the purchase of Electronic Conspicuity devices extended until March 2022. More details here @ [CAA Electronic Conspicuity funding subsidy](https://www.caa.co.uk/General-aviation/Aircraft-ownership-and-maintenance/Electronic-Conspicuity-devices/)

You may have noticed me, James, Mark, Joe and Wayne playing with large toasting forks and computer networks in recent days, this has all been in aid of improved Electronic Conspicuity and so here are the details of what we have done and how this can help you.

![array](images/2021/09/array.png)

We have installed and commissioned a Pilotaware ATOM station which is designed to share electronic conspicuity information. Have a read below for more details of what information is collected and rebroadcast.

We will also be shortly adding a TV display to the caravan so that we can see local traffic information. If you want to use this locally now from your own network connected device, then try [Rossall ATOM Station](http://192.168.1.166) We will be making this available from remote locations (home tec.)

## Is this of use to me?

Do you have to be an existing Pilotaware user? Yes, but no.

To get the full benefit of this facility then yes. I run my Pilotaware connected to my Skydemon tablet with an 3mm jack audio connection from my Pilotaware Rosetta to my MicroAvionics powered interface which also has a bluetooth connection back to the Skydemon tablet.

This provides me with audio and visual information from other Pilotaware users in the sky and also information relayed through the network of ATOM stations. Through my SkyDemon tablet, I will also be notified of the local ATOM station QNH if available.

I am aware that there are many SkyEcho users at the club. Pilotaware can ingest the ADSB-Out information from SkyEcho and make this available to Pilotaware users through the ATOM Grid.

If you are interested in further discussion on some of the pros and cons here, then have a look here @ [Which EC device?](http://forum.pilotaware.com/index.php?topic=1804.0)

## EC installation optimisation

You can use Pilotaware services to optimise the installation of your SkyEcho and other EC devices using their 'vector' service. Follow the links below and you will be able to see where you EC signal is being blocked. This is usually by water (humans) or metal objects (engine / bodywork). Remember that it is most useful to know what is in front of you.

[Pilotaware Vector](https://www.pilotaware.com/analysis/vector)

Here is a quick sample from my microlight installation. If you don't know your ICAO code, then you can find it here from the [G-INFO CAA Site](https://siteapps.caa.co.uk/g-info/)

Pick the date by clicking on the date to the right and select or deselect the days you are interested in analysing. This is of use in tracking improvements or degradations in the efficacy of your installation.

Then press 'Go' and look at the data.

Note that this data is just from circuits, so range is not impressive, but looks like I will need to check out what is happening at 10 o'clock. Maybe I will fly higher for a bit longer and then see how it looks before I make any changes.

## Analysing your flights

[Glider Radar](https://www.gliderradar.com/center/53.96235,-2.76512/zoom/12/time/15)

Do any of you look back at the tracks you have flown? This is another use of the EC information that is collected. If not, then have a look at the Aircrew web site services.

[Upload and display TRK file information](https://aircrew.co.uk/playback/)

or maybe of more use, have a look @ [Flight Track Playback](https://aircrew.co.uk/playback/groundstations/?ICAO=404bcd&RxType=PAW&adbVariant=*&Station=*&start=1630494000&end=1630504800)

You will need to add your ICAO code at the top left and optionally the Ground reception station of interest.

![Flight Playback settings](images/2021/09/flight-playback-settings.png)

Here I have selected my Skyranger ICAO code from when I took a quick trip down the beach to Fleetwood.

![Flight Track](images/2021/09/flight-track.png)

At the bottom of the display there is your flight height profile over time. If you drag the white ball at the bottom of the screen to left and right and you will see your track animate. For interest, you will also see which ground station was collection position information for your EC devices.

There is also the [Glider Radar](https://www.gliderradar.com/center/53.85374,-2.69234/zoom/11/time/15) service. It will show you current flight tracks.

Looks like it will be a busy day today at the Sywell Rally ![Sywell Rally](images/2021/09/sywell-rally.png)

Here is some indication of the coverage ![coverage1](images/2021/09/coverage1.png) that we have from the Rossall and MossEdge ATOM stations.

There are some informative videos on Youtube under this link [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/PilotAware)

I do not have all of the answers but feel free to ask any questions you may have.
